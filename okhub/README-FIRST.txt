Please note that the OKHub PHP Wrapper is required for this plugin to work.

Please download it from GitHub:
https://github.com/oriel-hub/OKHub-php-Wrapper/archive/master.zip
And expand it in a directory in the OKHub Content plugin's directory or one of it subdirectories (the preferred location is inside "includes").

Please also note that the directory "cache" should exist inside the PHP Wrapper's directory and it should be writable by web server user.

Please find in the "templates" directory examples of how to include imported fields and categories in documents and organisations.
In particular, take a look at how the imported content is included in the "content-okhub_documents.php" and "content-okhub_organisations.php" templates.
These are based on Wordpress' Twentytwelve theme. You can use them as a basis and adapt them to your specific theme.
